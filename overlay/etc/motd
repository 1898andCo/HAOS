Welcome to HAOS, the Hardened Applicance Operating System

Refer to https://github.com/1898andCo/HAOS for README and issues

The default mode of HAOS is to run a single node cluster. Use "kubectl"
to access it. The node token in /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token
can be used to join agents to this server.
