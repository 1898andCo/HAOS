Welcome to BLAOS, the BOHICA LABS Appliance Operating System!

Refer to https://github.com/BOHICA-LABS/BLAOS for README and issues

The default mode of BLAOS is to run a single node cluster. Use "kubectl"
to access it. The node token in /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token
can be used to join agents to this server.
